				The
				<a href="http://www.openarchitectureware.org"
					target="_blank" title="openArchitectureWare Homepage"
					class="marked">
					openArchitectureWare
				</a>
				project produces a powerful framework to build
				Generators for MDSD (Model-Driven-Software-Development) purposes.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a controller for the generation-process there is the
				<code>Workflow-Component</code>.
				With this component you can start multiple task you
				need to run to process the generation of code. With this
				<code>Workflow-Component</code>
				you can execute all task you have in a MDSD-Environment:
				Code-Generation, Model-2-Model-Transformation,
				Clean-Ups...
				<br />
				For this
				<code>Workflow-Component</code>
				there is an Eclipse-Plugin to execute your defined
				workflow comfortably.
			</p>
			<p>
				With this Maven2-Plugin you can integrate your workflow
				in your Build-Environment. This plugin is highly
				configurable. All things must be done only once, so you
				can use the Eclipse-Plugin and this Maven2-Plugin
				without duplicate the configuration.

		<section name="Features" id="features">
			<ul>
				<li>
					The worklow definition file can be freely configured
				</li>
				<li>
					The property mechanism of the
					<code>Workflow-Component</code>
					is reused in the Maven2-Plugin
				</li>
				<li>
					Support for 2 different source directories are
					included. This both directories will be appended to
					the compile classpath
				</li>
				<li>
					A list of resources can be configured to check
					whether they are up-to-date. If all resources older
					than the last generator-run, so the plugin stops the
					execution.
				</li>
